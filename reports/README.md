## Reports

R-Markdown reports. 
The `.Rmd` files are the "source" file with the R code.
These files are rendered into reports (`.md` files).

### Figures

- [Figures and tables on the latest dnSNP/ClinVar analysis](MHcut-Figures-dbSNPClinVar.md).
- [Density of variant with MH in a "chromosome" view](chromosomeView.md).
- [Number of genes with exonic variants](GeneOverlap.md)

### Variant databases

- [Exploration of variants in ClinVar](clinvarExploration.md).
- [Comparison of dbSNP and ClinVar](dbSNPClinVarExploration.md).

### How To

- [How to filter the "guide" output](pamFiltering.md).
- [Overlap variants and gene annotation](GeneOverlap.md)

### Benchmark

- [Allowing for 1 vs 2 consecutive mismatches in the MH.](1mismatchVs2mismatches.md).
- [What do we gain if we consider both flanking configuration instead of picking the one with best MH?](compare-1flank-2flanks-modes.md).
- [First (quick) try analyzing a subset of dbSNP](dbSNPcodingSmallDel.md).
- [Exploration of earlier results on pathogenic deletion in ClinVar](summaryOutput.md).
