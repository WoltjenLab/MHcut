This folder contains a small dataset to test MHcut's installation.
It's a subset of the first 1 bp from chr 20 and 30 randomly selected deletions fomr dbSNP.

Note that the off-target estimation will not be correct in this test because the reference doesn't the rest of the genome.
It's just here for testing purpose.
